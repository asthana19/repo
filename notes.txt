The two main important differences between logistic and linear regression are: 1. Dependent/response variable in linear regression is continuous whereas, in logistic regression, it is the discrete type. 2. Cost function in linear regression minimise the error term Sum(Actual(Y)-Predicted(Y))^2 but logistic regression uses maximum likelihood method for maximising probabilities
